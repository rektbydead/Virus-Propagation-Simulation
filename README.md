# Virus-Propagation-Simulation

This was a school project that was meant to show C memory management skills.
It was mandatory the usage of a LinkedList and an array.

This code was rewritten from the actual project that was given for evaluation. The code given for evaluation had bad code practices and a few memory leaks, that are hopefuly fixed now... Due to the lack of time, the code was not tested.

Hopefuly, there are no bugs, neither memory leaks :)
